      <p>The Darien Gap – a jungle region along the Colombia-Panama border – serves as a major transit point for extra-continental, Haitian, and Cuban migrants moving through the Americas en route to the United States. The dense jungle region is almost impenetrable given though there are small, indigenous communities throughout the approximately 50-kilometer stretch. As there are no roads, transportation through or around the Darien occurs in boat or canoe. These photos exemplify living conditions, transportation methods, and the denseness of the Darien’s vegetation but only some of the obstacles to crossing the Darien. Migrants face additional challenges including a lack of food and water; a proneness to drowning during flash floods; vulnerability to robbery and theft; and getting lost along the way.</p>
